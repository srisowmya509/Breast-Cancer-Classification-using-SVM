## ðŸ§  Breast Cancer Classification with SVM

This project implements binary classification to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign using Support Vector Machines (SVM) with linear and RBF kernels.

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Source**: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

### ðŸ”§ Features

- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Train SVM models with linear and RBF kernels
- Visualize decision boundaries using 2D PCA
- Tune hyperparameters (C and gamma) using GridSearchCV
- Evaluate model performance with cross-validation
